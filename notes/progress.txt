1. DB is working via tmpApp.py, make it work from the actual web server by URL arguments. getUser() + setUser()
2. Rewrite routes so that it fits passa hype
3. Rewrite model so that it fits passahype, and you can login/register users. Make sure tokens and password hashing is used.
    1. Token should be saved in DB after successfull login
    2. Token should be checked 

4. Refactor code. Remove redundnacies. Create more packages because app/ is getting way to big.
